             <p>right here. And I'll even give it an ID. We'll call it home-tiles so it'll be easier for us later to style this and have this kind of as a base. Okay, so let me copy and paste some of the code that I've pre-made for this lecture, and I'll go ahead and go over it afterwards. Let me close this div actually right here, and we'll take a look at it. Okay, so again, we're inside the row, and now we want every class. For the desktop, we'll concentrate on desktop first. For the desktop, we want md-4, md-4, and again, md-4, which means they add up to 12, which means every single one of them is going to take a third of the screen. And therefore we're going to have these three tiles on md. So at the medium screen and above, this will become a three tile type of layout.
                 Moving on down at the small level, meaning at the smaller screen size, so it's column small, the first two are column small 6. So they'll take up half the screen. And the third one, if you take a look, is 12th. So when we are at the small screen size, the first two will take out half the screen each, and therefore will take one, basically, row. And the third tile will slide down kind of to the second row, even though it's not a technically Bootstrap second row. But it'll slide down, and it will stretch the entire width of the grid. So therefore it will basically equal to the first two columns because they're 6 and 6. And finally, at the smallest level, at the extra small screen, we want every single one of those things to stack one upon the other. And
